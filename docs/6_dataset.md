# Dataset for Robotics

### Object Shapes
- [**ShapeNet**](https://shapenet.org/): ShapeNet is an ongoing effort to establish a richly-annotated, large-scale dataset of 3D shapes. We provide researchers around the world with this data to enable research in computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, and other related disciplines. [[Download]](https://shapenet.org/login/) [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03012)
- [**PartNet**](https://partnet.cs.stanford.edu/): PartNet: a consistent, large-scale dataset of 3D objects annotated with fine-grained, instance-level, and hierarchical 3D part information. [[Download]](https://www.shapenet.org/login/) [[Code]](https://github.com/daerduoCarey/partnet_dataset) [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02713)
- [**YCB**](https://www.ycbbenchmarks.com/): YCB Object and Model Set is designed for facilitating benchmarking in robotic manipulation. The set consists of objects of daily life with different shapes, sizes, textures, weight and rigidity, as well as some widely used manipulation tests.

- [**OmniObject3D**](https://omniobject3d.github.io/): OmniObject3D, a large vocabulary 3D object dataset with massive high-quality real-scanned 3D objects to facilitate the development of 3D perception, reconstruction, and generation in the real world. [[Download]](https://opendatalab.com/OpenXDLab/OmniObject3D-New/tree/main) [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07525) [[Code]](https://github.com/omniobject3d/OmniObject3D/tree/main)
- [**Objaverse-XL**](https://objaverse.allenai.org/): A Universe of 10M+ 3D Objects. Objaverse-XL is 12x larger than Objaverse 1.0 and 100x larger than all other 3D datasets combined.

### Articulated Objects
- [**PartNet Moblity**](https://sapien.ucsd.edu/browse): SAPIEN releases PartNet-Mobility dataset, which is a collection of 2K articulated objects with motion annotations and rendernig material. The dataset powers research for generalizable computer vision and manipulation. [[Download]](https://sapien.ucsd.edu/downloads) [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08515)

- [**AKB48**](https://liuliu66.github.io/articulationobjects/index.html): This is a realistic and physics-rich object repository for articulation analysis. It enables various robotic vision and interaction tasks that require detailed part-level understanding. More categories and download link will be released soon. [[Download]](https://liuliu66.github.io/articulationobjects/download.html) [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08432)

- [**GAPartNet**](https://pku-epic.github.io/GAPartNet/) (Merge and Provide more annotation from PartNet Mobility and AKB48): By identifying and defining 9 GAPart classes (lids, handles, etc.) in 27 object categories, we construct a large-scale part-centric interactive dataset, GAPartNet, where we provide rich, part-level annotations (semantics, poses).
