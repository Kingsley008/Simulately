# 3D Dataset for Robotics

### Object Shapes
- [ShapeNet](https://shapenet.org/): ShapeNet is an ongoing effort to establish a richly-annotated, large-scale dataset of 3D shapes. We provide researchers around the world with this data to enable research in computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, and other related disciplines. [Download](https://shapenet.org/login/); [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03012)
- [PartNet](https://partnet.cs.stanford.edu/): PartNet: a consistent, large-scale dataset of 3D objects annotated with fine-grained, instance-level, and hierarchical 3D part information. [Download](https://www.shapenet.org/login/); [Code](https://github.com/daerduoCarey/partnet_dataset); [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02713)
- [OmniObject3D](https://omniobject3d.github.io/): OmniObject3D, a large vocabulary 3D object dataset with massive high-quality real-scanned 3D objects to facilitate the development of 3D perception, reconstruction, and generation in the real world. [Download](https://opendatalab.com/OpenXDLab/OmniObject3D-New/tree/main); [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07525); [Code](https://github.com/omniobject3d/OmniObject3D/tree/main);
- [Objaverse-XL](https://objaverse.allenai.org/): A Universe of 10M+ 3D Objects. Objaverse-XL is 12x larger than Objaverse 1.0 and 100x larger than all other 3D datasets combined. [Download](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNOWKTHk3a7CGiegNjROFNfOcpzr5gt6G0FMEMQ8qXRTbs0Q/viewform); [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05663); [Code](https://github.com/allenai/objaverse-xl)


### Articulated Objects
- [PartNet Moblity](https://sapien.ucsd.edu/browse): SAPIEN releases PartNet-Mobility dataset, which is a collection of 2K articulated objects with motion annotations and rendernig material. The dataset powers research for generalizable computer vision and manipulation. [Download](https://sapien.ucsd.edu/downloads); [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08515)

- [AKB48](https://liuliu66.github.io/articulationobjects/index.html): This is a realistic and physics-rich object repository for articulation analysis. It enables various robotic vision and interaction tasks that require detailed part-level understanding. More categories and download link will be released soon. [Download](https://liuliu66.github.io/articulationobjects/download.html); [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08432)

- [GAPartNet](https://pku-epic.github.io/GAPartNet/) ((Merge and Provide more annotation from PartNet Mobility and AKB48)): By identifying and defining 9 GAPart classes (lids, handles, etc.) in 27 object categories, we construct a large-scale part-centric interactive dataset, GAPartNet, where we provide rich, part-level annotations (semantics, poses).
