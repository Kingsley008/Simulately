SoftZoo is a soft robot co-design platform for locomotion in diverse environments that,
- supports an extensive, naturally-inspired material set, including the ability to simulate environments such as flat ground, desert, wetland, clay, ice, snow, shallow water, and ocean.
- provides a variety of tasks relevant for soft robotics, including fast locomotion, agile turning, and path following, as well as differentiable design representations for morphology and control.

Evolution Gym is the first large-scale benchmark for co-optimizing the design and control of soft robots. In the benchmark, each robot is composed of different types of voxels (e.g., soft, rigid, actuators), resulting in a modular and expressive robot design space. The benchmark environments span a wide range of tasks, including locomotion on various types of terrains and manipulation.
