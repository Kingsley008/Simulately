# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Material Point Method (MPM)?

The Material Point Method (MPM) is a numerical technique used in computational mechanics for simulating the behavior of materials. It is particularly useful for problems involving large deformations, complex material behavior, or interactions between different phases of matter (like solids, liquids, and gases). MPM is a mesh-free method, which means it doesn't require a fixed mesh to calculate deformations, unlike traditional Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations.
