# Getting Started

Welcome to the Getting Started for using IsaacSim. Here, we will quickly go through:

1. An efficient way of development in Isaac Sim
2. Three workflows (GUI, extensions, and standalone extensions)
3. GUI in Isaac Sim
4. Standalone Python

Some information are borrowed from the [official docs of Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/index.html), but we provide a more concentrated version to get you ready.

## An efficient way of dev in Isaac Sim

Before we get started, here are several things you need to know:

1. Like other modules like the Create in Omniverse, Isaac Sim is also built on Omniverse Kit. Almost all the functions are implemented as "extensions", *i.e.* every action you do in the GUI can be implemented via coding.
2. You can find the Isaac Sim local folder at `INSTALL_DIRECTORY/pkg/isaac-sim-VERSION/`. For ubuntu, `INSTALL_DIRECTORY` is `~/.local/share/ov/` by default. It would be a rapid way, if you want to add new features to your app, to perform a search in this folder to find possibly relative codes.
3. For docs, always start from [this main page](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/index.html) for the latest version of the documentation, and use the built-in searching (rather than directly searching on Google, which may provide out-of-date links).

## Three workflows in Isaac Sim

There are three workflows in Isaac Sim that you can use to develop:

1. GUI: directly interacting with the Isaac Sim GUI, pushing buttons, connecting action graphs, to implement what you want. This is useful if you want to:
    - constructing a scene or buiding a robot
    - tune the physical parameters (*e.g.*, joint damping and stifness, light temperature, *e.t.c*)
2. Extensions: Start from the menu bar in a launched Isaac Sim, which pops out a panel for your app. You interact with your app inside. This is useful if you want to:
    - interact with your app or provide some arguments (*e.g.* the position you want the robot to go) to the app in play
    - build a plug-in for Isaac Sim, rather than just performing simulations
3. Standalone extensions: Start by running scripts, . This is useful if you want to:
    - run your app in headless mode
    - control over timing of physics and rendering steps

[This page](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/introductory_tutorials/tutorial_intro_workflows.html) provides a more thorough introduction.

## Quick-Start in Extensions

In this section, we will switch to the extensions workflow, which is a more structured way to programming, as you can leverage a pre-defined base classes `BaseSample` and you just to implement some APIs such as scene setup or physics step. Besides, saving the files in the extensions codes triggers hot-reload in Isaac Sim, which boosts your development.

### Create an Extensions with the `BaseSample` class.

Make a directory that is structured as:

```
.
├── config
│   └── extension.toml
└── scripts
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── demo.py
    └── demo_extensions.py
```

#### Edit the `extension.toml`

This file tells the Isaac Sim how to load the extension.

```ini
[core]
reloadable = true
order = 0

[package]
version = "1.0.0"
category = "Simulation"
title = "Isaac Sim Demo"
description = "Isaac Sim Demo for Simulately."
authors = ["Yuyang Li"]
repository = ""
keywords = ["simulately", "simulation", "robot"]
writeTarget.kit = true

[dependencies]
"omni.kit.uiapp" = {}
"omni.physx" = {}
"omni.isaac.dynamic_control" = {}
"omni.isaac.motion_planning" = {}
"omni.isaac.synthetic_utils" = {}
"omni.isaac.ui" = {}
"omni.isaac.core" = {}
"omni.isaac.franka" = {}
"omni.isaac.manipulators" = {}
"omni.isaac.dofbot" = {}
"omni.isaac.universal_robots" = {}
"omni.isaac.motion_generation" = {}
"omni.graph.action" = {}
"omni.graph.nodes" = {}
"omni.graph.core" = {}
"omni.isaac.quadruped" = {}
"omni.isaac.wheeled_robots" = {}

[[python.module]]
name = "scripts"

[[test]]
timeout = 960
```

#### Create a Base Extension in `demo.py`

```python
import numpy as np
from omni.isaac.core.objects import FixedCuboid, DynamicCuboid
from omni.isaac.examples.base_sample import BaseSample

class Demo(BaseSample):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        return

    def setup_scene(self):
        # Used to add assets.
        # Only called to load the world starting from an EMPTY stage.
        pass

    async def setup_post_load(self):
        pass

    def physics_step(self, step_size):
        pass
```

- The `setup_scene` allows us to add assets to the scene. It is called to load the world, only if the stage is totally empty.
- The `setup_post_load` is called upon hitting the "LOAD" button, working in an asynchronized way. It comes in handy to get the latest simulation handles.
- The `physics_step` is called in each simulation step when the simulation is running. You can add control logics to it to control the scene.


#### Set Up Extension Loading in `demo_extensions.py`

This file loads essential classes from the surrounding files to load the extension in to the simulation app.

```python
import os
from omni.isaac.examples.base_sample import BaseSampleExtension
from .demo import Demo
from omni.kit.menu.utils import add_menu_items, remove_menu_items
from omni.isaac.ui.menu import make_menu_item_description

EXTENSION_TITLE = "Launch Demo"

class DemoExtension(BaseSampleExtension):
    def on_startup(self, ext_id: str):
        super().on_startup(ext_id)
        super().start_extension(
            menu_name="",
            submenu_name="",
            name="Demo",
            title="Isaac Sim Demo",
            doc_link="",
            overview="Simulately Isaac Sim Demo",
            file_path=os.path.abspath(__file__),
            sample=Demo()
        )
```

#### Import Essentials in `__init__.py`

Just like any other `__init__.py`, this file imports essential libraries to make a package:

```python
from .demo import Demo
from .demo_extension import DemoExtension
```

### Set Up the Scene in `setup_scene`

We will set up the scene using the `setup_scene` function. We first add a ground plane to hold everything:

```python
def setup_scene(self):
    # ...

    world = self.get_world()
    world.scene.add_default_ground_plane()

    # ...
```

It first get the handle to the world to manage it with `self.get_world()`. Then, it adds a default ground plane with `add_default_ground_plane()`, which adds a blue-white plane to the world, which also includes a sphere light and other essential components.

Now, we will add a robot and some objects to the scene. For more information concerning stage management, please refer to [Stage Management in Isaac Sim](./stage_management)

#### Add a Robot

Then, we add a robot to the scene.


```python
def setup_scene(self):
    # ...

    world = self.get_world()

    # ...

    world.scene.add(Franka(prim_path="/World/Franka", name="franka"))
    self._franka = world.scene.get_object(f"franka")
```

#### Add a Table with a Cube

Now, let's add a table (a fixed cuboid) as well a cube on it (a dynamic cuboid), in front of the robot.

```python
def setup_scene(self):
    # ...

    world = self.get_world()

    # ...

    world.scene.add(
        FixedCuboid(
            prim_path=f"/World/table",
            name=f"table",
            scale=np.array([0.5, 1.25, 0.2]),
            color=np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0]),
            position=np.array([0.7, 0.0, 0.1])
        )
    )

    world.scene.add(self._franka)
    fancy_cube = world.scene.add(
        DynamicCuboid(
            prim_path="/World/cube",
            name="cube",
            scale=np.array([0.2, 0.2, 0.2]),
            color=np.array([0, 0, 1.0]),
            position=np.array([0.7, 0.0, 0.3])
    ))

    self._table = world.scene.get_object(f"table")
    self._cube = world.scene.get_object("cube")
```

### Set Up Physics Step Callback

In each simulation step, before computing the physics, you can manipulate the simulation with a callback function, which we usually set up using:

```python
async def setup_post_load(self):
    self._world = self.get_world()
    self._world.add_physics_callback("sim_step", callback_fn=self.physics_step)
    # ...

def physics_step(self, step_size):
    pass
```

### Physics States

To know about the physics states in the simulation, we can leverage APIs through the `World` instance.

```python
async def setup_post_load(self):
    # ...

    self._cube = self._world.scene.get_object("cube")

    # ...

def physics_step(self, step_size):
    # ...

    pos, rot = self._cube.get_world_pose()
    lin_vel = self._cube.get_linear_velocity()

    # ...
```

### Robot Control

To control the robot, there are several ways. The most direct way is to apply action while providing the desired joint positions:

```python
def physics_step(self, step_size):
    # ...

    self._franka.apply_action(ArticulationAction([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])) # Desired joint positions for arm
    # or
    self._franka.apply_action(ArticulationAction([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.04])) # Desired joint positions for arm and gripper

    # ...
```

This will control the robot to the given joint positions with a controller, and the joint positions in the list is matched following the joint indices. Also, for a robot like Franka Emika Panda, the built-in implementation allows you to interact with the `Robot` and `Articulation` APIs, for instance,

```python
def physics_step(self, step_size):
    # ...

    self._franka.apply_action(ArticulationAction([0.04, 0.04])) # Desired joint positions for gripper
    
    # ...
```

For more advanced ways of controlling the robot, consider referring to [RMPFlow](./rmpflow), [Controlling Robots with ROS Bridge](./control-robots-ros-bridge), *e.t.c*.

## Quick-Start in Standalone Extensions

Coding in Isaac Sim endows powerful simulations. In this section, we will switch to the standalone extensions, a way more flexible way. Go to your installation directory of your isaac sim (`INSTALL_DIRECTORY/pkg/isaac-sim-VERSION`), you will find a `python.sh` here. To start a standalone app, you run:

```shell
./python.sh PATH_TO_YOUR_APP.py
```

### Create a Standalone Extension

Now, let's add something to our script. First, we launch the simulation with

```python
from omni.isaac.kit import SimulationApp
simulation_app = SimulationApp({"headless": False})

from omni.isaac.core import World
# other imports
```
This two lines is recommended to be added as the very first two lines of your script, as importing other dependencies before them may cuase problems.

### Adding a cube and a robot

TBD.

### Adding a camera to the robot
